# Game of Simon - Pokemon Version

This is the repo where I will keep the code used to create the 90's game of Simon (similar to Bop-It), but with a special twist: the 4 buttons are the 4 starting pokemon of the original pokemon series (Charmander, Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Pikachu). A live version of this can be found on [codepen](http://codepen.io/elefun/pen/dMaypy).
